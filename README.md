# IntelliJ Tutor

## Intention

This tutor helps you to learn more shortcuts for Jetbrain IDEs, so that you can work much faster and save a lot of time on
repetitive tasks. Although it's called IntelliJ Tutor, the shortcuts I mention work for WebStorm, CLion and all the other Jetbrains IDEs as well.

## About This Project

The name and the project are an homage to the Vimtutor. When I started learning Vim with all of it shortcuts, it was so great
to have the Vimtutor to guide me through the most basic commands to control Vim.

As I have to work a lot with IntelliJ and Android Studio these days, I thought it would be nice
to have a tutor for these IDEs too.

## How to Start the Tutor

If you haven't, you should install the Java SDK to view the code examples.

Next off, clone the repository by doing `git clone https://github.com/NWuensche/IntelliJTutor`.

After that, just open the project folder inside IntelliJ IDEA and open the file `Start.txt`. Everything else will
be explained there.

## How to Participate

If you found any mistakes, if you want to translate the tutor or if you have any other idea to make this project
better, any help will be welcome. Just create an issue or a pull request.
