Welcome to the IntelliJ Tutor

IntelliJ is an awesome IDE, but very few people use all the shortcuts to become a much faster programmer.
For most tasks, it is much faster to press a combination of keys rather than to move your fingers
to your mouse or touchpad, clicking on the right button.
For this reason, you can finish all tasks here without touching your pointing device once. It will feel
awkward to do everything with your keyboard first, but after some time, you will get used to it.
Don't feel bad if you use your mouse in the beginning, just go back to your keyboard and
continue the training.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to move inside and between files, and how to edit your files faster.

It is not important if you use WebStorm, PyCharm or any other JetBrain IDE. The shortcuts I show
work for all of them, so share this tutor with all of your friends!

You will need about 15 minutes to complete this introduction, if you don't use any shortcuts
right now. Of course, if you already know a lot of them right now, you won't need all of the time.

This tutorial is meant to be done multiple times. You won't be an expert after finishing it for the first time,
because repetition is key to using the shortcuts intuitively in your daily work.
