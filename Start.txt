Welcome to the IntelliJ Tutor

IntelliJ is an awesome IDE, but very few people use all the shortcuts to become a much faster programmer.
For most tasks, it is much faster to press a combination of keys rather than to move your fingers
to your mouse or touchpad, clicking on the right button.
For this reason, you can finish all tasks here without touching your pointing device once. It will feel
awkward to do everything with your keyboard first, but after some time, you will get used to it.
Don't feel bad if you use your mouse in the beginning, just go back to your keyboard and
continue the training.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to move inside and between files, and how to edit your files faster.

It is not important if you use WebStorm, PyCharm or any other JetBrain IDE. The shortcuts I show
work for all of them, so share this tutor with all of your friends!

You will need about 15 minutes to complete this introduction, if you don't use any shortcuts
right now. Of course, if you already know a lot of them right now, you won't need all of the time.

This tutorial is meant to be done multiple times. You won't be an expert after finishing it for the first time,
because repetition is key to using the shortcuts intuitively in your daily work.

Part 1: Basic Movement

In this part, you will learn the most basic shortcuts to move between words, lines and files.
It is meant as a good foundation for part 2, where we will learn more about moving inside source code.

Lesson 1.1: Single Letter Movement

It is not very efficient to move the cursor with your touchpad. To move the cursor,
press the arrow keys on your keyboard

1. Just move a little bit around, until you feel used to it.
2. Move down to lesson 1.2

Lesson 1.2: Movement Between Words

It can take you quite a while to move from the beginning of a line to the end
just by pressing the right arrow key.
Therefore, we will learn how to move from word to word, and not just from letter to letter.
Press Ctrl+Right to move from word to word to the right, and Ctrl+Left to move to the left.
You can even move to a word on the next line, when you are at the start or end of a line.

1. Move through this sentence word by word, until you feel used to it.
2. Move down to lesson 1.3

Lesson 1.3: Movement Between Code Blocks

Now you know how to move horizontally. However, if you want to move vertically faster than with the arrow
keys, you can use Ctrl+[ and Ctrl+] to move between matching brackets.

1. Move to the line marked with ->
2. Move to the bracket on this line, until it becomes yellow
3. Press Ctrl+] to move to the matching bracket.
4. Train this shortcut on the other brackets as well
5. Go to lesson 1.4

-> {

[ ()
]

}

Lesson 1.4: Movement Between Lines

Now you know how to move fast vertically. But if you know the line number you want to jump to,
you can be even faster by pressing Ctrl+G and enter the line number you want to go to.
If you want to move back to the line you edited last, press Ctrl+Shift+Backspace.

1. Add the name of your favourite programming language at the end of the line: Java
2. Move to line 100 by pressing Ctrl+G
3. Move back to this section by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Backspace
4. Move to Lesson 1.5


Lesson 1.5: Movement Between Files (Unopened)

Of course, most of our project consist of more than one file. Therefore, it is necessary
to move efficiently between them too.
If you want to jump to a file which isn't opened in your IDE right now, press Ctrl+Shift+N
and enter the name of the file you want to jump to.

1. In this project, there is a file called "OtherFile.txt". Open this file by pressing
Ctrl+Shift+N and typing the name of the file. You can find the next lesson there.
